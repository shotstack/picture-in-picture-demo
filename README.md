# Shotstack Picture-in-Picture Demo

This project demonstrates how to use the Shotstack cloud video editing API to build an 
application that adds picture-in-picture functionality to your video using 
a form.

An HTML web form allows the user to input a base video and picture-in-picture video, 
decide where to place it, and set other options such as scale, length and offsets. 
A video is then created by the Shotstack API that overlays the picture-in-picture video 
on top of the video.

The demo is built using Node JS and can be used with either Express Framework or deployed 
as a serverless projects using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

### Requirements

- Node 8.10+
- Shotstack API key: https://dashboard.shotstack.io/register

### Project Structure

The project is divided in to a two components:

#### Backend API

The backend API with an endpoint, which  prepares the edit and posts the data to the 
Shotstack API. A status endpoint is also available which can be polled to return the 
status of the video as it renders.

The backend API source code is in the _api_ directory.

#### Frontend Web Form & Player

The frontend is a simple HTML form that allows the user to enter a search term and basic 
options to create a video. The form uses jQuery to submit the data to the backend API and 
poll the status of the current render. There is also a video player that is loaded with 
the final rendered video when ready.

The front end API source code is in the _web_ directory.

### Installation

Install node module dependencies:

```bash
cd api
npm install

```

### Configuration

Copy the .env.dist file and rename it .env. Replace the environment variables below with your
Shotstack API key (staging key):

```bash
SHOTSTACK_API_KEY=replace_with_your_shotstack_key
```

### Run Locally

To start the API and serve the front end form (from the _api_ directory):

```bash
cd api
npm run start
```

The visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


### Deploy Serverless Application (optional)

The project has been built as a serverless application using the Serverless Framework 
and AWS Lambda. To understand more about the Serverless Framework and how to set 
everything up consult the documentation: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/

To deploy to AWS Lambda (from the _api_ directory):

```bash
cd api
npm run serverless
```

Once the API is deployed set the `var apiEndpoint` variable in **web/app.js** to the returned
API Gateway URL.

Run the **web/index.html** file locally or use AWS S3 static hosting to serve the web page.
